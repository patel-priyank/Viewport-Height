# Viewport Height

A simple demo to showcase the behavior of CSS viewport height units (`vh`, `svh`, `lvh`, and `dvh`). The project provides interactive buttons to switch between these units and visually demonstrates how each unit responds to changes in the browser's viewport, especially on mobile devices.
