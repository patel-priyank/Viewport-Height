      The CSS units vh, svh, lvh, and dvh are viewport-relative lengths used to define element dimensions based on the
      viewport's height. The vh unit represents 1% of the current viewport height, commonly used for general layouts.
      The newer svh measures 1% of the smallest possible viewport height, useful for ensuring designs adapt to UI
      overlays like virtual keyboards. Conversely, lvh represents 1% of the largest possible viewport height, ignoring
      dynamic changes caused by browser UI, making it ideal for fullscreen layouts. Lastly, dvh dynamically adjusts to
      changes in viewport height, updating in real time when UI elements like address bars or keyboards appear or
      disappear, providing responsive behavior on modern devices. These units are best experienced on mobile devices,
      where viewport changes due to virtual keyboards and UI overlays are most noticeable.
